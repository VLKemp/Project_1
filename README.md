## Water-Source-Mortality

This [repo](https://github.com/RHockley/Project-1-Water-Source-Mortality) was the cumulative efforts of Robbie Hockley, Danny Bruzzese and Vanessa Kemp. Our hypothesis was to ascertain whether if a country has a higher GDP per capita, then the average deaths of children due to unsafe water sources will decrease.
